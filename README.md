# 🐄✨ Flying Mooo ✨🐄
## 🚀 A game born from a mistake and a joke... JUST FOR FUN! 🎮

It all started as a joke... and somehow, it turned into a game! 🤣

🎭 The Origin Story:
📜 Once upon a practical exam...

I forgot to close my loop with an ELSE statement, yet the code ran perfectly in Jupyter Notebook! 🤷‍♂️💻
My instructor, visibly annoyed 😤, told me to fix it!
Being my rebellious self, I boldly stated: "IF THE CODE IS CORRECT, DON'T TOUCH IT!" ⚡😎
To which my instructor, with great wisdom, replied: "IT LOOKS LIKE A COW WITH FOUR FEET, BUT STILL, IT DOESN'T WALK... IT FLIES!" 🐄🚀
And just like that, an idea was born! 💡🐄💨

🎮 Introducing: Flying Mooo!
A game based on a mistake and a joke, where the best part is: The entire script has NO ELSE STATEMENTS 🚫❗ ... except where "GRAVITY" is defined! 🌍⬇️

🐄 Flap your way through the sky in a gravity-defying adventure! 🚀💨
🔀 No ELSE? No problem! Let’s see how far this cow can fly! 😂

💻 Code with NO ELSE but ALL the FUN! 😆🎉

Although the initial plan was to add a lot of levels or endless gameplay to it, while creating the game the environment kept on crashing!!
